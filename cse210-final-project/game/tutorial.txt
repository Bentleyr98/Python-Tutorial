Welcome to our tutorial! We'll first start off with a simple

function to output "Hello World." This is what it looks like


print("Hello World")


The "print" is built in function for Python. Functions always have 

parameters () to input an argument. Here we are inputting 

"Hello World" as our argument into the parameter.

Because we are printing out a string(text), we want our arugment 

in quotations like in our example above.

Go ahead and give it a shot and try other short phrases as well!
